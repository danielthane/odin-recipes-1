    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces farfalle pasta</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 small onion</li>

        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water, bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the bow tie pasta and return to a boil. Boil pasta, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well. </li>
